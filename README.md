virus.py - Creates folders: spam + "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" with a **for** loop. 

Magic8Ball.py - The magic 8 ball cloned in a program, the cool thing about this program is that it has only 4 lines still works as a regular Magic 8 Ball program written in Python. My fellow programmers had written a Magic 8 Ball program (in python) which had 10-16 lines.


PasswordDetection.py - What this program does is to ask the user for their password and prints "That's one strong password" if the len() function returns 8 and if it doesn't it prints out "May god have mercy on your account".
